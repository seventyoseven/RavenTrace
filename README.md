## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 **Port Scanner** – Lightweight tool to identify open TCP ports  
- 🌐 **Netdiscover Integration** – Gathers live hosts on the local network  
- 🛡️ **OpenVAS Automation** – Launch scans via API and extract vulnerability reports  
- 🔐 **Secure Remote Shell** – SSL-encrypted server-client communication  
- 🕵️ **Traffic Obfuscation** *(Optional)* – Mimics normal web traffic to remain undetected  
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** – Use each module independently or together

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `netdiscover`
- [OpenVAS](https://www.greenbone.net/en/) or GVM server
- Python packages:
  - `python-gvm`
  - `ssl`, `socket`, `subprocess`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install python-gvm
```

🧪 How to Use
1. Scan for Live Hosts
python netdiscover_parser.py

3. Run a Port Scan
python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.10

4. Trigger OpenVAS Scan
python openvas_integration.py

5. Launch Secure Remote Shell
On attacker/server machine: python server.py
On target/client machine: python client.py

🧠 Learning Objectives
By exploring and using RavenTrace, you’ll develop hands-on experience in:

🔌 Socket programming and secure communication (SSL)

🔗 Client-server architecture

📡 Network scanning and reconnaissance

⚙️ OpenVAS API automation with python-gvm

🎭 Traffic obfuscation and evasion tactics

🔁 Modular, reusable Python scripting for red teaming

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 **Port Scanner** — Lightweight scanner for identifying open TCP ports
- 🧠 **Netdiscover Parser** — Extracts live IPs from the local subnet using `netdiscover`
- 🛡️ **OpenVAS API Integration** — Automates vulnerability scans using OpenVAS's API
- 🔐 **Secure Client-Server Remote Shell** — Encrypted SSL communication for safe command execution
- 🕵️ **Traffic Obfuscation** *(Optional)* — Simulate legitimate-looking HTTP traffic
- 📦 **Modular Design** — Each component is separate and reusable for custom workflows

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `netdiscover`
- [OpenVAS](https://www.greenbone.net/en/) or GVM server
- Python packages:
  - `python-gvm`
  - `ssl`, `socket`, `subprocess`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install python-gvm
🧪 How to Use
1. Scan for Live Hosts
python netdiscover_parser.py

2. Run a Port Scan
python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.10

3. Trigger OpenVAS Scan
python openvas_integration.py

4. Launch Secure Remote Shell
On attacker/server machine: python server.py
On target/client machine: python client.py

🧠 Learning Objectives
This project is built for cybersecurity learners and aspiring red teamers. By using it, you'll get hands-on experience with:

Low-level networking (sockets, SSL)

Command execution pipelines

API usage (OpenVAS via python-gvm)

Reconnaissance workflows

Traffic disguising techniques

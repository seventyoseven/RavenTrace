## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 **Port Scanner** – Lightweight tool to identify open TCP ports  
- 🌐 **Netdiscover Integration** – Gathers live hosts on the local network  
- 🛡️ **OpenVAS Automation** – Launch scans via API and extract vulnerability reports  
- 🔐 **Secure Remote Shell** – SSL-encrypted server-client communication  
- 🕵️ **Traffic Obfuscation** *(Optional)* – Mimics normal web traffic to remain undetected  
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** – Use each module independently or together

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run **RavenTrace**, make sure your system has the following:

### 🔧 Environment
- 🐍 Python 3.10+
- 🌐 [`netdiscover`](https://github.com/netdiscover-scanner/netdiscover)
- 🛡️ [OpenVAS/GVM](https://www.greenbone.net/en/) vulnerability scanner

### 📦 Python Packages
- `python-gvm`
- Standard libraries: `ssl`, `socket`, `subprocess`

### 💡 Installation

```bash
pip install python-gvm
```

---

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Scan for Live Hosts**
   ```bash
   python netdiscover_parser.py
   ```

2. **Run a Port Scan**
   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.10
   ```

3. **Trigger an OpenVAS Vulnerability Scan**
   ```bash
   python openvas_integration.py
   ```

4. **Launch the Secure Remote Shell**
   - On the **attacker/server** machine:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
   - On the **target/client** machine:
     ```bash
     python client.py
     ```
